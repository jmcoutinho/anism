It needs to be geared to the real needs of all people rather than the excessive consumption of a few, and to be underpinned by more cooperative mechanisms rather than controlled by a small number of powerful companies.</blockquote>

            <h1>The Woman Who Married a Cabinet</h1>
            <p>Frustrated with how material objects were being treated around her, Yvonne Dröge Wendel, an artist and at the time student at the Rietveld Academie, embarked on a quest to question and rethink how we relate to the material entities we interact with in our everyday lives, that still lasts today.</p>

            <p>The project in focus here is the one Yvonne developed for her graduation in 1992. Taking her ideas to the extreme as a form of illustration, she committed to a lifelong marriage with a Wendel cabinet, with which she spent an enviable honeymoon in the south-east of Portugal.</p>

            <p>The immense side effects of our lack of material respect are becoming all too familiar as we roam down this devastating path of mindless consumerism. Some of the most obvious instances of that are in our oceans; in the synthetic continents of disposed, rarely used more than once, bits and pieces of undead plastic.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5203824/" target="_blank">A Plastic Ocean</a>, directed by Australian journalist Craig Leeson in 2016, tries at portraying this alarmingly recent reality in an inquiry into the requirements of human development.</p>

                <p style="margin: 0;">Becoming an anist can be outlined in three ordered stages:<br><em>a.</em> Consciously noticing and understanding the material entities that surround you – the objects you own, the ones you interact with in your daily life, etc.<br><em>b.</em> Learning to discern an aura within those objects. This is something that might derive from self-reflection: what is it that makes you respect and value them, where does their worth come from?<br><em>c.</em> Employing this aura to augment material entities, generally, amplifying their significance and their lives.</p>

            <p>Anism is a new movement, but its ideals have been around for a long while. They were inherent to the beliefs and mythologies that guided the indigenous peoples that populated the lands we now inhabit. In fact, they were included in some of the patterns most commonly found by the Anthropologists who coined them under the term 'animism'.</p>
            <h2>Animism</h2>
            <p>Animism, in its own rights, is one of Anthropology's earliest concepts, as conceived by Sir Edward Tylor, the creator of its currently accepted definition.<br>It can be described as the belief that all material entities possess a 'distinct spiritual essence'. That the division between physical and spiritual is tenuous, all substantial matter requiring an equivalent degree of respect and consideration.</p>
            <h2>Anism</h2>
            <p>Anism, on its turn, is the urbanised cousin of animism. It's a movement that presupposes action for the change of behaviour and mentalities in a time in which disposability is the norm and materiality has lost the amplitude of its meaning in our lives.</p>
            <h2>Anist Manifesto</h2>
            <p>The myths that founded our societies are outdated, the uncertainty they tried to enlighten is no longer of considerable relevance. We now, more than ever, need new foundational allegories that can help us confront the perils of unsustainability.<br>What anism proposes is that we take from the ideals of animism and apply them to our individualities and our time. That we look after and enlarge the auras – the value and integrity – of the material goods which comprise our lives: that we build on their histories, on their idiosyncrasies; that we know when to let go of them respectfully, always making sure the aura is leastwise maintained, never diminished and never lost.</p>
