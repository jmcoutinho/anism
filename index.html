It needs to be geared to the real needs of all people rather than the excessive consumption of a few, and to be underpinned by more cooperative mechanisms rather than controlled by a small number of powerful companies.</blockquote>

            <h1>The History of Anism</h1>
            <p>Anism is a new movement, but its ideals have been around for a long while. They were inherent to the beliefs and mythologies that guided the indigenous peoples that populated the lands we now inhabit. In fact, they were included in some of the patterns most commonly found by the Anthropologists who coined them under the term 'animism'.<br>Animism, in its own rights, is one of Anthropology's earliest concepts, as conceived by Sir Edward Tylor, the creator of its currently accepted definition.<br>It can be defined as the belief that all material entities possess a 'distinct spiritual essence'. That the division between physical and spiritual is tenuous, all substantial matter requiring an equivalent degree of respect and consideration.</p>

            <p>Anism, on its turn, is the urbanized cousin of animism. It's a movement that presuposes action for the change of behaviour and mentalities in a time in which disposability is the norm and meteriality has lost the amplitude of its meaning in our lifes.<br>The myths that founded our societies are outdated, the uncertainty they tried to enlighten is no longer of considerable relevance. We now, more than ever, need new foundational allegories that can help us confront the perils of unsustainability.<br>What anism proposes is that we take from the ideals of animism and apply them to our individualities and our time. That we look after and enlarge the auras – the value and integrity – of the material goods which comprise our lives: that we build on their histories, on their idiosyncrasies; that we know when to let go of them respectfully, always making sure the aura is leastwise mantained, never diminuished and never lost.</p>
